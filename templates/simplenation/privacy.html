			<p>This Privacy Policy describes how and when simplenations collects, uses, and shares your information when you use simplenations, including our mobile applications and websites (the "Services"). Simplenations receives your information through our website, email notifications, and other interactions with our Services. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country you reside in or supply information from, you authorize simplenations to use your information in the United States and any other country where simplenations operates.</p>

			<p>information collection and use</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Creating a simplenations account and profile Information: When you create a simplenations account, you must provide access credentials either in the form of an email address and password. You may optionally provide us with additional profile information, including a profile picture. You may update or modify your profile information and contact information at any time. Profile information is available publicly on our Services, such as on your profile page.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Contact Information: In addition to using your contact information to create your account, we may use this information to send you information about simplenations, respond to your requests and facilitate your use of simplenaitons. We may use the contact information (such as your email address) to help connect you with other simplenations users, even if that information is not publicly displayed.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Content, Voting, Posting, Commenting and other Public Information: Simplenations is a opinion sharing platform, so all of the information you provide us is information that will become public. Beforementioned information includes not only the Content that you post and data provided with such Content, such as when it was posted, but also the accounts that you choose as your favorites, the Content that you comment on, and other public interactions on the Services. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For instance, your profile information and public Content are immediately delivered to a wide range of users and other services that access simplenations. When you share information or Content via simplenations, you should think carefully about what you are making public.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Links: We may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve simplenations, for example to provide relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Cookies: Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve simplenations. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. Simplenations may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with simplenations, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on simplenations, and to customize and improve our Service. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. If you do not want cookies from simplenations or other websites, you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some parts of simplenations may not function properly if you disable cookies.</p>

Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Service, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Service,view videos hosted by simplenations, or interact with our email notifications. Simplenations uses Log Data to provide its services and to measure, customize, and improve them. If not already done earlier, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 18 months.</p>

These third-party service providers may use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your use of our Services and other websites and services, including your IP address, device ID, pages viewed, and links clicked.
