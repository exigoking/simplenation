			<br/>
			<p>29. We reserve the right to remove contents alleged to be infringing without prior notice and at our sole discretion. In appropriate circumstances, simplenations will also terminate a user's account if the user is determined to be a repeat infringer.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>30. If we remove your user content in response to a copyright or trademark notice, we will notify you via email with a copy of the notice. If you believe your user content was wrongly removed due to a mistake or misidentification of the material, you can file a counter-notice with us that includes the following:</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Your physical or electronic signature;</p>
			<p>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and where the material was located online before it was removed or access to it was disabled;

			Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of federal district court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which the service provider may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under DMCA 512 subsection (c)(1)(c) or an agent of such person.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>31. Upon receiving a counter-notice we will forward it to the complaining party and tell them we will restore your content within 10 business days. If that party does not notify us that they have filed an action to enjoin your use of that content on simplenations before that period passes, we will consider restoring your user content to the site.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>a few more legalities</p>
			<br/>
			<p>32. Please read the following very carefully. Each of the following sections applies to the maximum extent permitted by law. Where jurisdictions do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, the contents of this section may not apply.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>indemnity</p>
			<br/>
			<p>32. All the things you do and all the information you submit or post to simplenations remain your responsibility. Indemnity is basically a way of saying that you will not hold us legally liable for any of your user content or actions that infringe the law or the rights of a third party or person in any way.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>33. Specifically, you agree to hold simplenaitons, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and third party service providers harmless from and defend them against any claims, costs, damages, losses, expenses, and any other liabilities, including attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of or related to your access to or use of simplenations, your violation of these terms, and/or your violation of the rights of any third party or person.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>disclaimer of warranties</p>
			<br/>
			<p>34. Simplenations is provided "as is" and without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we and our affiliates and third party service providers disclaim any and all warranties, express or implied, including (but not limited to) implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement of proprietary rights, or any other warranty, condition, guarantee or representation, whether oral or electronic. You are solely responsible for any damage to your computer or mobile device, loss of use, or loss of your user content. We do not guarantee that simplenations will always work properly.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>limitation of liability</p>
			<br/>
			<p>35.
			We will not be liable for any special, consequential, indirect, incidental, punitive, reliance, or exemplary damages, whether in tort, contract, or any other legal theory, arising out of or in any way connected with this agreement or your use of or attempt to use simplenations, including (but not limited to) damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, or data. This limitation on liability shall not be affected even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Some states do not allow for the exclusion of implied warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusions may not apply to you. You may have other rights that vary from state to state.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>36. You agree to release us, our affiliates, and third-party service providers, and each associated director, employee, agents, and officers, from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential), of every kind and nature, known and unknown, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected to your use of simplenations.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>governing law</p>
			<br/>
			<p>37. We want you to enjoy simplenations, so if you have an issue or dispute, you agree to raise it and try to resolve it with us informally. You can contact us with feedback and concerns here or by emailing us at hello@simplenations.com.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>38. The headings in these terms are for convenience and do not control any of its provisions.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>39. Any claim or dispute between you and us arising out of or relating to these terms, in whole or in part, shall be governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario without respect to its conflict of laws provisions. We agree and you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal court located in Toronto, Ontario.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>severability and enforcement</p>
			<br/>
			<p>40. If any provision of these terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be modified to the extent necessary to render it enforceable without losing its intent. If no such modification is possible, that provision will be severed from the rest of these terms.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>41. If we do not enforce any right or provision in these terms, that is not to be deemed a waiver of our right to do so in the future.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>changes to terms of service</p>
			<br/>
			<p>We may update these terms from time to time, the most current version will always be at <a href="{% url 'terms' %}">http://simplenations.com/terms</a>. If the revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you via email to the email associated with your account or through the Service. If you do not wish to be bound by any such revisions to the terms, you must discontinue to use simplenations. By continuing to access or use simplenaitons after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.</p>
